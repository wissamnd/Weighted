## Getting started

To build the app you need to create your own Firebase application according to guidlines on [Firebase codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/#4).

For android you need to provide own `google-services.json` file. It is explained in [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/#4) and [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0).
